This is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I built it with keras API (Tensorflow backend). Firstly, I will prepared the data (handwritten digits images) then i will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation.
My submission on Kaggle achieved 99.17% accuracy.
