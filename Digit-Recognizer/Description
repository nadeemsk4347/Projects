This is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset.
I built it with keras API (Tensorflow backend).
Firstly, I prepared the data (handwritten digits images) then I focused on the CNN modeling and evaluation.
My submission on Kaggle achieved 99.17% accuracy.
